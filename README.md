Final Capstone project
This was a level 3 project pertaining to the use of functions, strings, list, dictionaries and loops. This project involves using a day to day scenario of asking a user to input their username and password to access two different files. It uses robast error handling to ensure different inputs by the user are taken into consideration and to avoid a crash of the program.
